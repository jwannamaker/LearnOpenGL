**1. Using the last transformation on the container, try switching the order around by first rotating and then translating. See what happens and try to reason why this happens.**

This happens because matrix multiplication applies the visual transformations in right-to-left order, meaning the combined transformation matrix is first translating the image then rotating w.r.t. the origin ```(0.0, 0.0)```. Since the image is already at some coordinate ```(x, y)``` when the rotation occurs, it's no longer rotated on an axis that is centered on the image. It gives the appearance of moving the smiley face in a circle.

In order to produce the same effect of rotating in place in the corner of the screen but still apply a rotation before a translation, it would be necessary to rotate the image relative to the translated location. For instance: 

```c++
smileyPosition = glm::vec2(0.75f, 0.75f);
transformMatrix = glm::rotate(transformMatrix, t, glm::vec3(smileyPosition, 1.0f));
transformMatrix = glm::translate(transformMatrix, glm::vec3(smileyPosition, 1.0f));
```
