Playing with matrix transforms using [```glm```](https://github.com/g-truc/glm), a C++ header-only library for matrix, vector, and quaternion operations that are compatible with OpenGL.

In the main render loop, I added tests for right and left arrow key presses, so the container rotates clockwise (right arrow) or counterclockwise (left arrow). 

<pre><code>
```c++
while (/* window is open */)
{
    [ ... ]
    if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_LEFT) == GLFW_PRESS)
    {
        transformMatrix = glm::rotate(transformMatrix, glm::radians(0.1f), glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f));
    }
    if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_RIGHT) == GLFW_PRESS)
    {
        transformMatrix = glm::rotate(transformMatrix, glm::radians(-0.1f), glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f));
    }
    
    glUniformMatrix4fv(transformMatrixLocation, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(transformMatrix));
    [ ... ]
}
```
</code></pre>

*Note:* I made the color at each vertex change according to its new transformed position by modifying the vertex shader to output the vertex position (```gl_Position```) as the color to the fragment shader. This has the effect of making the colors on the container almost seem like lighting instead of a stationary filter that stays fixed on the same vertices. As the container rotates, the color at each vertex changes.
