**1. Adjust the vertex shader so that the triangle is upside down.**

*Note:* I modified the output vector of the vertex shader to have a negative y-value, which flips all the vertices across the x-axis (i.e. input ```(x, y, z)``` --> output ```(x, -y, z)```). This works without an additional translation of the vertices because NDC places ```(0, 0)``` directly in the center of the canvas.
