**3. Output the vertex position to the fragment shader using the ```out``` keyword and set the fragment's color equal to this vertex position (see how even the vertex position values are interpolated across the triangle). Once you managed to do this; try to answer the following question: why is the bottom-left side of our triangle black?**

The 'color' in the bottom left side of the triangle is ```(-0.43f, -0.25f, 0.0f)```, although the values for colors are only accepted in the range ```[0.0 - 1.0]``` which means any negative values would simply be clamped to the closest value in the range before rendering. Effectively, ```(-0.43f, -0.25f, 0.0f)``` becomes ```(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f)``` (black).
