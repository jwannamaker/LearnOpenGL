**2. Specify a horizontal offset via a uniform and move the triangle to the right side of the screen in the vertex shader using this offset value.**

*Note:* I thought it would be more interesting to make the triangle move back and forth between the right and left sides of the screen.

I accomplished this with the following code:

```c++
float horizontalOffset;
while (/* window is open */)
{
    [ ... ]

    myShader.use();
    horizontalOffset = sin(glfwGetTime()) / 2.0f;
    myShader.setFloat("horizontalOffset", horizontalOffset);
    
    [ ... ]
}
```
