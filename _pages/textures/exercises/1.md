**1. Make sure only the happy face looks in the other/reverse direction by changing the fragment shader.** 

My first attempt:

```c++
FragColor = mix(texture(texture0, TexCoord), texture(texture1, -TexCoord), 0.2);
```


At first, this appears correct since the image is flipped, although it's flipped across both axes instead of one, and upon further examination, the texture coordinates are technically no longer in the valid range for this approach. I suspect the only reason I still see the image is because of the texture wrapping parameters I have set to be repeating. I should be passing coordinates between ```0.0f``` and ```1.0f``` for both the x and y components, so first a vertical flip would give ```(x, -y)``` with x staying in the valid range while y now exists between ```-1.0f``` and ```0.0f```, so an additional translation is needed by ```(x, 1 - y)```. 

The correct solution now becomes:

```c++
FragColor = mix(texture(texture0, TexCoord), texture(texture1, vec2(TexCoord.x, 1 - TexCoord.y)), 0.2);
```
