My first cube! 

The reason why the cube looks off is because currently, OpenGL has no way to tell what should be in front and what should be in back, so the triangles are all drawn in the same order every frame making the cube look weird and very much like physics is broken. 

*Note:* I made the cube move in a more interesting pattern than what's demonstrated in the book by using ```sin``` and ```cos``` to determine the axis of rotation. 

```c++
// In main.cpp
while (/* window is open */)
{
    [ ... ]
    float t = glfwGetTime();
    model = glm::mat4(1.0f);
    model = glm::rotate(model, t * glm::radians(50.0f), glm::vec3(0.25 * sin(t), 0.25 * cos(t), 0.0f));
    glUniformMatrix4fv(modelMatrixLocation, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(model);
    // draw the cube
    [ ... ]
}
```
