**3. Try to make every 3rd container (including the 1st) rotate over time, while leaving the other containers static using just the model matrix.**

For this exercise, I oscillate the position of each cube between a sphere-like formation and a cube-like formation while rotating every other cube. I changed the axis of rotation by parameterizing a unit circle on the xz-plane.

In the above video, I added the x (green), y (red), and z (blue) axes to further clarify the movement pattern of the changing rotation axis.
