**2. Play with the view matrix by translating in several directions and see how the scene changes. Think of the view matrix as a camera object.**

Initially, I decided to use the arrow keys to translate and rotate the view matrix, hoping to simulate a similar experience to an FPS POV. To do this, I created a simple Camera struct like so:

```c++
struct Camera {
    glm::mat4 view;
    glm::vec3 position;

    Camera(glm::mat4 view, glm::vec3 position)
    {
        this->view = translate(view, position);
        this->position = position;
    }
};
```

My thought process was by keeping track of the position associated with the view matrix, I could more easily determine an axis of rotation to apply on the camera and create the effect of rotating the camera in place.

I figured the ```processInput(GLFW* window)``` function was a great place to move my camera movement logic, so I modified the funciton header to accomodate camera transformations: ```processInput(GLFW* window, Camera& camera)```; Below is my implementation.

```c++
void processInput(GLFWwindow* window, Camera& camera)
{
    float cameraSpeed = 0.01f;
    float cameraRotateSpeed = glm::radians(0.1f);

    if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_ESCAPE) == GLFW_PRESS)
    {
        glfwSetWindowShouldClose(window, true);
    }

    glm::vec3 axis = glm::vec3(camera.position.x, 1.0f, camera.position.z);
    if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_LEFT) == GLFW_PRESS)
    {
        camera.view = glm::rotate(camera.view, cameraRotateSpeed, axis);
    }
    if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_RIGHT) == GLFW_PRESS)
    {
        camera.view = glm::rotate(camera.view, -cameraRotateSpeed, axis);
    }

    if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_DOWN) == GLFW_PRESS)
    {
        camera.position = glm::vec3(camera.position.x, camera.position.y, camera.position.z + cameraSpeed);
        camera.view = glm::translate(camera.view, camera.position);
    }
    if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_UP))
}
