**Hello Triangle (Exercise #1)** - Try to draw 2 triangles next to each other using glDrawArrays by adding more vertices to your data.

**Hello Triangle (Exercise #2)** - Now create the same 2 triangles using two different VAOs and VBOs for their data.

**Hello Triangle (Exercise #3)** - Create two shader programs where the second program uses a different fragment shader that outputs the color yellow; draw both triangles again where one outputs the color yellow.
