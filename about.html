<p>
    Hello! This site is built with Jekyll and GitHub Pages, and serves as a digital notebook and a showcase of my ongoing work in computer graphics and software engineering.
</p>

<p>
    The first portion of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">Gallery</a> is dedicated towards my work through <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Introduction">LearnOpenGL.com</a>, which is a free, online book with easily digestible lessons, examples, and excercises that make it a popular introduction to the realm of graphics programming.
